# Example C++ Response Signature Verification

This is an example of cryptographically verifying Keygen's legacy `X-Signature` response signature header
using your Keygen account's public key. You can find your public key within
[your account's settings page](https://app.keygen.sh/settings). We recommend
using [our new `Keygen-Signature` header](https://keygen.sh/docs/api/#response-signatures),
which better prevents replay attacks among other attack vectors. We will try
to update this example repository for the new format soon.

## Running the example

First up, add an environment variable containing your public key:
```bash
# Your Keygen account's public key (make sure it is *exact* - newlines and all)
export KEYGEN_PUBLIC_KEY=$(printf %b \
  '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n' \
  'zdL8BgMFM7p7+FGEGuH1I0KBaMcB/RZZSUu4yTBMu0pJw2EWzr3CrOOiXQI3+6bA\n' \
  # â€¦
  'efK41Ml6OwZB3tchqGmpuAsCEwEAaQ==\n' \
  '-----END PUBLIC KEY-----')
```

You can either run each line above within your terminal session before
starting the app, or you can add the above contents to your `~/.bashrc`
file and then run `source ~/.bashrc` after saving the file.

On macOS, install OpenSSL v1.0.2p using `homebrew`.
```bash
brew install openssl@1.0.2
```

Next, on macOS, compile the source using `g++`:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o bin.out \
  -std=c++17 \
  -lssl \
  -lcrypto \
  -I /usr/local/opt/openssl/include \
  -L /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
```

Then run the script, passing in the `body` and `signature` as arguments:
```bash
./bin.out '{JSON_RESPONSE_BODY}' '{LEGACY_RESPONSE_SIGNATURE}'
```

The response body's signature will be verified using RSA-SHA256 with PKCS1 v1.5
padding. Be sure to copy your public key and other arguments correctly - the response
signature will fail validation if these are copied or included incorrectly. You can
find your public key in [your account's settings](https://app.keygen.sh/settings).

## Running on other platforms

We are only including instructions on how to compile and run this example on
macOS. If you'd like to create a PR with instructions for another platform,
such as Windows or Linux, please feel free to open a PR.
